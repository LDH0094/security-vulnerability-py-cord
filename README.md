### CVE-2022-36024
### The following project aims to monitor one of the major vulnerabilities of Discord API wrapper, py-cord.

Note, not to accidentally open your bot with the specific version of this py-cord, as doing so would potentially put the bot in danger of allowing excessive control to other users. 

v.2.0.0 thus, is highly vulnerable to remote shutdown if they are added to the server with the `application.commands` scope without the `bot` scope.

### Bot added with application.commands Scope

By adding the Bot that was created with py-cord v.2.0.0 with `application.commands` that only embeds `/` commands onto the server without `bot` online status showing, would critically shutdown the entire custom bot system when users try to use any of the registered commands. (e.g., /ping or /hello would shutdown the entire custom bot system).
