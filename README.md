### CVE-2022-36024
### The following project aims to monitor one of the major vulnerabilities of Discord API wrapper, py-cord.

Note, not to accidentally open your bot with the specific version of this py-cord, as doing so would potentially put the bot in danger of allowing excessive control to other users. 

v.2.0.0 thus, is highly vulnerable to remote shutdown if they are added to the server with the `application.commands` scope without the `bot` scope.

### Bot added with application.commands Scope

By adding the Bot that was created with py-cord v.2.0.0 with the  `application.commands` scope without the `bot` scope that only embeds `/` commands onto the server without `bot` online status showing, This vulnerability would critically shutdown the entire custom bot system when users try to use any of the registered commands.

### High Vulnerabilty of CVE-2022-36024
High Vulnerabilty of CVE-2022-36024
When adding a bot, usually it comes with a url that is generated by Discord that includes the scope need by the Discord server. https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&permissions=0&scope=applications.commands+bot

The url parameters can be easily manipulated and malicious actors can remove the `+bot` in the url,

> https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&permissions=0&scope=applications.commands+bot
> <img src="screenshots/+bot.png" alt="with_bot_scope"  height="300">


to

> https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&permissions=0&scope=applications.commands
> <img src="screenshots/without_+bot.png" alt="without_bot_scope"  height="300">

> *Note how the `Add a bot to a server` portion is now gone*

This leads to the bot being added without the `bot` scope. These actors can then remotely shutdown the bot by using any of the availble slash commands of the bot.
